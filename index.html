								Unlike other clubs at UVic our goal is to provide a unique experience of actually participating in local motorsport in an affordable and approachable mannor.
								It's a fact that racing is an extreamly expensive sport and hobby, we strive to bridge the cost gap, allowing students to explore their passions.
								Having club managed cars available to students to work on and compete is a key unique feature to our club.
								This allows for students of any background, and any skill level to work togther and develop something that wouldn't be possible without our club.

							<h2>Our road map</h2>
							<p>
								As a newly founded club we're going to be officially ratified by the UVSS Board of Directors at the start of the 2020 summer semester. Our first objective will be to raise money for a car. We have several sponsors who have tenativly agreed to providing funds for our first vehicle. Once we make our purchase we'll have to do basic maintenance, and begin prepping the car for the track. This will include changing all fluids, making sure brakes and tires are in good condition, and making sure all safety equipment is up to date. We'll also remove any items that won't be nessacery for the track. Once the car has been prepped we'll take it to autocross events (also known as Auto-X or Autoslalom). These events are low cost, with a low barrier to enter and provide a perfect proving ground for our team. As our car and team progresses in local autocross we'll begin prepping the car for tracks days and club racing. This includes racing suspension, roll cage, protective harnesses and seats, racing tires, racing brakes, and much more. This phase will be the most costly step after purchasing our car. Once we are fully prepaired for the track we'll particape in test and tune and track days prepairing the team and car to eventually go club racing. Our goal is to have a car ready for club racing by the end of spring 2021.
